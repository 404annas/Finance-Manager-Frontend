# 💻 FINANCE-APP-BACKEND

**FINANCE-APP-BACKEND** is the secure, reliable, and feature-rich backend service powering the FINANCE-APP frontend dashboard and upcoming mobile app.  
It handles authentication, payment scheduling, transactions, email reminders, file uploads, and user management with a modular and maintainable architecture.

---

## ✨ About the Project

This backend is built using **Node.js and Express** and follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern for clean separation of concerns.  
It acts as the central API for the FINANCE-APP, managing all server-side business logic, database interactions, secure communication, and integration with external services.

Key functionalities include:  
- **User Authentication & Authorization** using JWT and middleware (`authMiddleware.js`)  
- **Payment & Transaction Management** including scheduling, categorization, and reminders (`transactionController.js`, `schedulePayment.js`)  
- **Automated Email Notifications** using Nodemailer (`reminderMailer.js`, `inviteUser.js`)  
- **File Upload Handling** via Multer & Cloudinary for images (`cloudinary.js`, `multer.js`)  
- **Scheduled Tasks** with Node-Cron for recurring reminders (`cron.js`)  
- **Secure & Scalable Architecture** with Helmet, CORS, and dotenv for environment configuration  

This backend ensures all operations are **secure, fast, and consistent** with the frontend dashboard and future mobile applications.

## 🖥️ Backend Flow (Integration with Frontend)

1. **User Authentication** → Client logs in/registers → Backend verifies credentials → Returns JWT token.  
2. **Dashboard Data Fetch** → Frontend requests user dashboard → Backend sends real-time payments, transactions, and chart data from MongoDB.  
3. **Payments & Transactions** → Users create or update payments → Backend saves to database → Sends confirmation & updates shared users.  
4. **Email Notifications** → Scheduled or triggered emails (reminders, invites) sent via Nodemailer & cron jobs.  
5. **File Uploads** → Users upload images → Multer temporarily stores → Cloudinary uploads → Returns URL to frontend.  
6. **Shared/Collaborative Payments** → Backend manages invited users, recipients, and shared transactions → Sends real-time updates to collaborators.  
7. **Admin Controls** → Admin API routes allow managing users, monitoring transactions, and overseeing the platform.
